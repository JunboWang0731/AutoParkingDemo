This is a simple describe of 'AutoParkingDemo':
'Apriltags2_VO-master' contains the launch file to launch two continuous tag detection node at same time;
''usb_cam' is the package to launch two camera at same time (remember that if you want to use different camera.info you need to set the path in launch file correctly)
'odometry' can receive the messages (relative pose from camera to tag) and transport them to the united OXY coordinate of groud;(it will generate a YAML file used to calibration, rememner put the path in multi.cpp and build it again)
In fact the 'A' and 'usb_cam' packages are from other guys and I only make some small change to fit my project. The 'odo' is package that just suitable for my project. 
'serialPort' is a simple node to read the serialPort and send other messaegs according to waht it received.
