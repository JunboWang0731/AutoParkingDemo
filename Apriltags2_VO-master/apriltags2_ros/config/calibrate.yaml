#This yaml file is used to calibrate the camera position
#So every time the camera was moved, we need to rewrite this file.
#Usage:
#Set all the parameter( x, y and orientation to be 0)
#run the launch file and copy the parameters measured by apriltag
#rewrite the parameters here
#Now you can use it to locate the moving apriltag in a fix frame.
